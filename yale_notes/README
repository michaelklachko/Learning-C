I started working through C tutorial, June 24, 2016
command:
gcc -std=c11 -g3 -o filename filename.c
for profiling:
gcc -gp3 -static -o f f.c and add -lm if including math library
Ofast option is more aggressive than O3
gcc -S will produce an assembly source code file
Adding another line...
Testing git commit -v option, which should include diif into the commit description message.
